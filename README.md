## About  

Bantas — is a lightweight, educational programming language designed to make programming simple, experimental, and fun. The word Bantas is a Tagalog term for a punctuation mark. It was originally developed by Jon Velasco (a.k.a muthym) in 2013 using Rapid-Q, and later revived in August 2025 with the help of AI. The modern prototype is now built on Lua.

- **2013** → Initial release (interpreter was written in Rapid-Q)  
- **2014** → Last update of the interpreter
- **2025** → Revival in Lua (prototype with AI-assisted refinements)  

The language emphasizes **simplicity**, **experimentation**, and **accessibility**, making it an approachable tool for **students, hobbyists, and curious learners**.
